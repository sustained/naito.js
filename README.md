## Genesis 1

In the beginning Tim Berners-Lee created the inter and the webs.

Now the interwebs was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of Berners-Lee was hovering over the tubes.

And Berners-Lee said, "Let there be Brendan Eich," and there was Brendan Eich.

Brendan Eich saw that the browsing was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.

Brendan Eich called the light "Netscape Navigator" and Microsoft called the darkness "Internet Explorer" And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.

And Microsoft said, "Let there be an expanse between the Netscape Navigator and the Internet Explorer to separate good and bad."

So Microsoft made the expanse and separated the good from the bad under it. And it was so.

Microsoft called the expanse "monopoly" And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.

And Netscape said, "Let the remains of the Navigator be gathered to one grave, and let open source appear." And it was so.

Netscape called the open source "Mozilla" and the gathered remains he called "Firefox." And Berners-Lee saw that it was good.

Then Berners-Lee said, "Let the interwebs produce languages: seed-bearing HTML and CSS and JavaScript on the interwebs that bear libraries and frameworks with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.

The interwebs produced languages: HTML and CSS bearing libraries according to their kinds and JavaScript bearing libraries in it according to their kinds. And Berners-Lee saw that it was good.

And there was evening, and there was morning--the third day.

And Berners-Lee said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the Firefox from the Internet Explorer, and let them serve as signs to mark browser progress and evolution.

and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light in the interwebs." And it was so.

Berners-Lee made two great lights--the ECMAScript specification to govern the JavaScript and the W3C to govern the HTML/CSS. He also made the WHATWG, for kicks and giggles.

Berners-Lee set them in the expanse of the monopoly to give light to the interwebs.

to govern the Firefox and the Internet Explorer, and to separate light from darkness. And Berners-Lee saw that it was good.

And there was evening, and there was morning--the fourth day.

And Berners-Lee said, "Let the JavaScript teem with living libraries, and let frameworks fly above the interwebs across the expanse of the monopoly."

So Berners-Lee created the great jQueries and Prototypes and every living and moving Bootstrap and 960gs with which the interwebs teems. And Berners-Lee saw that it was good.

Beners-Lee blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the websites in the interwebs."

And there was evening, and there was morning--the fifth day.

And Berners-Lee said, "Let the JavaScript evolve standard libraries according to their kinds: Arrays, Objects, Functions and so on, each according to their kind." And it was so.

Berners-Lee made the Array methods according to their kinds, the Object methods according to their kinds, and all the methods that move along the Function prototype according to their kinds. And so on. And Beners-Lee saw that it was good.

Then Berners-Lee said, "Let us make Naito in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the libraries and the frameworks of the Javascript, over all the interwebs, and over all the standard libraries that move along the prototypes."

So Berners-Lee created Naito in his own image, in the image of Berners-Lee he created him; male and female he created them.

Berners-Lee blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the interwebs and subdue it. Rule over the browsers of the monopoly and the libraries and frameworks that move through the JavaScript"

Then Berners-Lee said, "I give you every seed-bearing web language on the face of the whole interwebs - HTML and CSS and Javascript, that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for libraries.

And to all the libraries of the interwebs and all the frameworks and tools--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every standard library for food." And it was so.

Berners-Lee saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning--the sixth day.

Thus the interwebs was completed in all its vast array.

By the seventh day Berners-Lee had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.

Then Berners-Lee blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.

## Genesis 2

Yawn, boring.

## Genesis 3

Now the sustained was more crafty than any of the wild libraries and frameworks that the Lord Berners-Lee had made. He said to the Naito, "Did Berners-Lee really say, 'You must not eat from any standard library in the JavaScript'?"

The Naito said to the sustained, "We may eat fruit from the standard libraries in the JavaScript,

but Berners-Lee did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the `reduce` that is in the middle of the `Array.prototype`, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"

"You will not certainly die," the sustained said to the Naito.

For Berners-Lee knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like Berners-Lee, knowing Navigator and Internet Explorer."

When the Naito saw that the fruit of the `Array.prototype.reduce` was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, Naito, who was with her, and he ate it.

Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized the standard library was naked; so they sewed a new library together and made `reduce` versions of the various functions therein for themselves.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord Berners-Lee as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord Berners-Lee among the standard libraries of the JavaScript.

But the Lord Berners-Lee called to the man, “Where are you?”

He answered, "I heard you in the standard libraries, and I was afraid because the standard library is naked; so I hid."

And he said, "Who told you that the standard library was naked? Have you eaten from the `reduce` that I commanded you not to eat from?”

The man said, "The woman you put here with me—she gave me some `reduce` from the tree, and I ate it."

Then the Lord Berners-Lee said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”

The woman said, "The sustained deceived me, and I ate."

And you know the rest.
